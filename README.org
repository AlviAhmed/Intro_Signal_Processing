*Status:* Completed 
*Type:* ELE792 Lab

* Objective 

The objective of this lab was to create, develop and modify various
real-time signals using Code Composer Studio. 


** Part 1 

Part 1 of this lab involves creating a sine wave from a
lookup table. The frequency of this signal is then varies by 250Hz increments via
a GEL slider. 

** Part 2 

Part 2 of this lab involves creating a cosine waveform from the same
lookup table as the sine wave. This was done by putting the sine and
cosine waves in quadrature.

** Part 3 

Part 3 involves designing and generating an amplitude modulated
signal. After which GEL sliders are created and used to adjust the
frequency of the modulated signal, frequency of carrier and modulation
index of the modulated signal.
